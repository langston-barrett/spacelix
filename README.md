# Spacelix

Spacelix is [Spacemacs][spacemacs] for [Helix][helix]! This project consists of
two Helix configurations:

- [spacemacs-compat.toml](./src/spacemacs-compat.toml) ports Spacemacs
  keybindings to Helix. It's useful for Spacemacs users who would like to try
  Helix and gradually learn new keybindings, rather than all at once.
- [spacelix.toml](./src/spacelix.toml) is a Helix configuration built with
  Spacemacs-style principles in mind, but it does not strive to emulate
  Spacemacs. It often has shorter key sequences than `spacemacs-compat.toml`.

The remainder of this README discusses `spacelix.toml`, AKA Spacelix.

The Spacelix keybindings are designed according to the following goals:

- [Mnemonic][pillar-mnemonic]: Key bindings are organized using mnemonic
  prefixes like b for buffer, w for window, f for file, etcâ€¦
- [Consistent][pillar-consistent]: Similar functionalities have the same key
  binding everywhere thanks to a clearly defined set of conventions.
- Safe: Spacelix avoids modifier keys (shift, ctrl) to reduce the risk of RSI.

## Bindings

Some of these bindings match Helix defaults, those are marked with "(default)".

    - `SPC j j`: Open the jumplist picker
    - `SPC j n`: Jump forward in the jumplist (mnemonic: "next")
    - `SPC j p`: Jump backward in the jumplist (mnemonic: "previous")

  - `SPC X`: Helix
    - `SPC X f`: Open configuration file
    - `SPC X l`: Open the Helix log file
    - `SPC X r`: Reload configuration
    - `SPC X t`: Tutor

The following key bindings are for `vi`/Spacemacs-emulation purposes.

- Normal mode:
  - `0`: Go to start of line
  - `$`: Go to end of line
  - `H`: Go to top of window
  - `L`: Go to bottom of window
  - `M`: Go to center of window
- Select mode:
  - `0`: Go to start of line
  - `$`: Go to end of line
  - `H`: Select previous sibling

And the following are just for good measure:

- Select mode:
  - `J`: Shrink selection
  - `K`: Expand selection
  - `L`: Select next sibling
  - `M`: Go to center of window

## Conventions and Mnemonics

- `n` means "next", preferred over "forward"
- `p` means "previous", preferred over "backward"
